You need to have `cookiecutter` installed in order to scafold a new project from this template. If you have `pip` installed, you simply do this by running:

    pip install --upgrade cookiecutter

After the installation is successful, you can create a new django project by simply running:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/Fueled/cookiecutter-django.git

It will ask you to some questions, after which it will create a new project in your current working directory. It will also create a virtualenv in the folder `venv` inside the project, and install all the python dependencies inside it.

Once the cookiecutter is finishes, you'll have:

2. Installed all the npm packages required
3. Installed all the python dependencies in virtualenv
4. Local settings added to .env file (untracked)
